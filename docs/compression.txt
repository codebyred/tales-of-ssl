Compressing / Decompressing

Purpose: Reduce data size for efficiency.

    Compressing: Takes raw data and encodes it in a way that takes up less space (using algorithms like gzip, zlib, brotli, etc.).

Decompressing: Restores the compressed data back to its original form.

    Compression can be lossless (no data lost, e.g., ZIP, PNG) or lossy (some data lost for size, e.g., MP3, JPEG).
