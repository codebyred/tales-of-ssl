Encoding / Decoding

Purpose: Convert data into a different format for transmission or storage (often to ensure compatibility or safety).

    Encoding: Converts data into a different format using a known scheme.

        Example: UTF-8 encoding turns characters into bytes.

        Example: Base64 encodes binary data into text so it can be sent over text-only channels like email or JSON.

    Decoding: Reverses the encoded format back into its original form.

    ðŸ’¡ Not meant to hide data or reduce size â€” just makes data readable by systems or protocols.
