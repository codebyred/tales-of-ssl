# Encoding / Decoding

**Purpose:** Convert data into a different format for transmission or storage â€” often to ensure compatibility or safety.

## Encoding

Encoding converts data into a different format using a known scheme.

- **Example:** UTF-8 encoding turns characters into bytes.
- **Example:** Base64 encodes binary data into text so it can be sent over text-only channels like email or JSON.

## Decoding

Decoding reverses the encoded format back into its original form.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Encoding is *not* meant to hide data or reduce size â€” it simply ensures that data is readable and compatible with systems or protocols.
