In the Rust openssl crate:

PKey	Stands for Envelope Public Key

PKey<Private> — means it contains a private key, which also implies it has the public key part.

PKey<Public> — contains only the public key.

The full form of PKey in OpenSSL (and in the Rust openssl crate) is:

    Private Key (or Public Key) — it's short for "EVP_PKEY", which stands for: 
    
    *Envelope Public Key*

    EVP = Envelope — the high-level cryptographic API in OpenSSL.

    PKEY = Public Key — can also contain the private key.

    EVP_PKEY is a generic OpenSSL structure that can hold:

        RSA keys (public or private)

        EC keys

        DSA keys

        DH parameters

        and more...
