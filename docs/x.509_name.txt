An X.509 Name (also called a Distinguished Name, or DN) is a structured set of attributes that uniquely identifies
an entity (like a person, organization, or server) in an X.509 certificate.

It is used in digital certificates to describe who the certificate is for 
    â€” such as the owner of a website's SSL certificate or the signer of a digital document.
