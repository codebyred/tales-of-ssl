Serializing / Deserializing

Purpose: Convert objects/data structures into a format that can be stored or transmitted.

Serialization: Converts in-memory objects into a storable or transmittable format (like JSON, XML, or binary).

    Example: Turning a Python dictionary into a JSON string.

Deserialization: Reconstructs the original object/data structure from the serialized format.

    This is used for data persistence, APIs, and communication between systems.
